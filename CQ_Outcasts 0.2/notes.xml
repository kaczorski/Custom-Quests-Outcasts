IDEAS
>multiple outcomes, as in multiple possible hediffs on recruitment
>multi-staged quests - fetch smth or someone, or just wait and return to activate another stage. Is it possible?
>lab conducting dubious experiments

Refugees > outcasts
>refugee spawn guard, sitting on a chair - under the chair is antigrain warhead, if he feels threatened he will blow up everyone
>rich explorer
>rich spoiled explorer, wants Dubs toilet (patch! the better, the better hediff he gets) as a proof o colony's advancement
>hunter who tried to kill thrumbo and succeeded but lost all of his family in the process. A cave where he commemorated his family, go and investigate
to gain his favour, but getting him to his full potential requires more than just commiserating
>depressed guy, doesn't care what will happen to him. Possible to lift him up, but not an easy job
>insectoid guy (with HaiLuan hediffs) being a face of "hellstrom's hive" - potential deathtrap, can be swayed to leave. Nice hediff if player
kills rest of insectoids?
>eager guy, but explore surroundings and discover he murdered his brother and his brother's wife;
>z-level enthusiast
>guy guarding his bed (its a legendary bed)
>man in black (in waiting)
>man in black (in reverse - you are the one taken to be a man in the black)
>mad scientist
>cannibal surrounded by a herd of domesticated wild men (with hediff that gives more meat)

>man in red

there are two conditions that can be valid at the same time:
-const 11up
-const 16up
which one will fire?
Answer: they don't fire, they are players choices. With Con16, you can choose from two - pretend to be less skilled or state the truth.
