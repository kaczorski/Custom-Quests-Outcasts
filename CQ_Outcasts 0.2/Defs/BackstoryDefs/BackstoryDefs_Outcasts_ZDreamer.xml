    <baseDesc>Instead of learning how to grow crops and tend to cattle, [PAWN_nameDef] preferred to sow mischief. [PAWN_pronoun] got into one fight after another and refused to change [PAWN_possessive] ways. When a disastrous Shift struck, there was no love lost for [PAWN_nameDef] among [PAWN_possessive] people. The intense dislike for the farmwork stayed with [PAWN_objective] for the rest of [PAWN_possessive] life.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s parents forced [PAWN_objective] to obey by stuffing [PAWN_possessive] head with terrifying stories. It worked too well. [PAWN_nameDef] learned what was required of [PAWN_objective], but with time fear gave way to fascination. [PAWN_pronoun] started researching tales of terror, especially stories about a dreaded Man in Red. [PAWN_nameDef]'s creepy interests alienated [PAWN_objective] from the rest of [PAWN_possessive] community long before a disaster struck.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was expected to help on [PAWN_possessive] family's farm, but as the years went by [PAWN_pronoun] became fascinated with making, not growing things. [PAWN_possessive] harmless side projects developed into a desperate pursuit of perfection. What's worse, [PAWN_nameDef]'s favourite material was steel and [PAWN_possessive] parents - fire survivors - hated that their child wanted to be a smith. [PAWN_nameDef] depressive mood made the situation even more difficult.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>Forced to travel from settlement to settlement in order to make silver, [PAWN_nameDef] became a very profficient builder and miner. It was a hard life among hard people and [PAWN_pronoun] had to learn how to fight for [PAWN_objective]self. Somewhere along the line, [PAWN_possessive] original directness soured into a much rougher attitude.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>Always needing more silver, [PAWN_nameDef] decided to radically cut [PAWN_possessive] expenses. In time [PAWN_pronoun] became indifferent to harsh living conditions and looked for work only when out of resources. As a consequence, [PAWN_nameDef]'s social skills took a massive hit.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>Travelling from place to place in search of work, [PAWN_nameDef] stumbled across a kindered soul who became passionate about [PAWN_possessive] goals. They travelled together for a long time and, as they scraped for plasteel and fought side by side, their friendship grew into something more. But years of vagrant lifestyle took their toll on [PAWN_nameDef]'s partner. Forced to choose between love and [PAWN_possessive] obsession, [PAWN_pronoun] chose the latter.</baseDesc>
