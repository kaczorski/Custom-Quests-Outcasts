# Custom Quests: Outcasts
**Rimworld + Dialogs = Story**

ToDo:
- [ ] do the PawnKind properly, create Base for Outcasts;
- [ ] add custom backstories, about 3 + 3, so there's bit of randomness but at the same time character's story is not all over the place;
- [ ] add Z Level (make terrain, 2 hediffs);
- [ ] add an interaction with survival meal;
- [ ] add more dirt around the house;
- [ ] work out how to make quest spawn only once;

- [ ] write another dialog!
