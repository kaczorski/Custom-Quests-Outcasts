# Custom Quests: Outcasts
**Rimworld + Dialogs = Story**
<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO50EwJ9FUI3FxHBxKowBkidPd9Cov5GzEyvC7XTpuo/edit?usp=sharing (about designing dialog and interactions)

ToDo:
- [x] do the PawnKind properly, create Base for Outcasts;
- [x] add custom backstories, about 3 + 3, so there's bit of randomness but at the same time character's story is not all over the place;
- [ ] pawn spawning with synthread or hyperweave. Solution: create custom faction.
- [x] add Z Level (make terrain);
- [ ] add Z hediffs and dialog for Z;
- [ ] remove "remove dialog manager" in loops;
- [x] setup object in Z Level to interact with;
- [x] add more dirt around the house;
- [x] work out how to send signal to destroy Z Level entrance. Done!
- [ ] work out how to make quest spawn only once;
- [ ] add hostile "response" to destroying walls, rewrite dialog to match;
- [x] rewrite bit about survival meal;
- [ ] rewrite bit about z level, foreshadow action unlocked by hediff;
- [ ] write bit with z-vertigo;
- [ ] remove "visible if not available" in conditions;
- [ ] add generated messages when important changes take place: ZDreamer hostile, recruited, entering place beyond, rep gained.
- [x] add a dialog version to read in the crapper;
- [ ] write another dialog!
