# Custom Quests: Outcasts
**Rimworld + Dialogs = Story**
<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO50EwJ9FUI3FxHBxKowBkidPd9Cov5GzEyvC7XTpuo/edit?usp=sharing (about designing dialog and interactions)

ToDo:
- [x] do the PawnKind properly, create Base for Outcasts;
- [x] add custom backstories, about 3 + 3, so there's bit of randomness but at the same time character's story is not all over the place;
- [ ] pawn spawning with synthread or hyperweave. Sort it out.
- [ ] add Z Level (make terrain, 2 hediffs);
- [ ] add an interaction with survival meal;
- [x] add more dirt around the house;
- [ ] work out how to make quest spawn only once;
- [ ] add hostile "response" to destroying walls/ stealing meal;
- [ ] write another dialog!
