ToDo:
- [x] do the PawnKind properly, create Base for Outcasts;
- [x] add custom backstories, about 3 + 3, so there's bit of randomness but at the same time character's story is not all over the place;
- [x] pawn spawning with synthread or hyperweave. Solution: create custom faction.
- [x] add Z Level (make terrain);
- [x] add Z hediffs, thoughts and dialog for Z;
- [x] option for spoilers added!;
- [x] setup object in Z Level to interact with;
- [x] add more dirt around the house;
- [x] work out how to send signal to destroy Z Level entrance. Done!
- [x] work out how to make quest spawn only once. Not viable ATM;
- [x] add hostile response to destroying walls;
- [x] rewrite bit about survival meal;
- [x] rewrite bit about z level, foreshadow action unlocked by hediff;
- [x] redo strange walls to be destructible and deconstructible;
- [x] remove "visible if not available" in conditions;
- [x] add generated messages when important changes take place: ZDreamer hostile, recruited, etc. Wallbreaker - would spam with messages.
- [x] make sure signals are working (spot.destroyed);
- [x] add a dialog version to read in the crapper;
- [x] check CQF for typos, edit Survivor;
- [x] work out how to make quest end :D;
- [x] work out why cannot load my custom maps;
- [x] dimensional anomaly;
- [x] message on entering Z Level (trap befor self destruct)
- [x] missing two massive text nodes!
- [x] Wallbreaker: give option to retreat;
- [x] ZDreamer not attacking. Create a custom hediff to give them berserk.
- [x] rat bonus dialog
- [x] error terrain for Z: two error terrains!
- [x] rat hediff;
- [x] finish dialogs, test;
- [x] add message on arrival explaining that quest is accomplished;
- [x] signals not working from dialogs;
- [x] playtest!
- [x] CQF major update: rework Wallbreaker assignement (cut out hediff.comp);
- [x] add message when walls destroyed, avoid spam by sending messages to a devtrap that selfdrestructs after first signal;
- [ ] look into creating map variants and blacklisting biomes. At the moment: cold biomes > no heating inside. Heating inside > stupid in tropical. BUT the dialog! Crap. No campfire inside, but wooden stuff in tropical, for the sake of learning new feature. Double walls in cold;
- [ ] add berserk as a consequence when dreamerDreams and walls deconstructed (signal from interaction)?
- [ ] write another dialog!
