<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO50EwJ9FUI3FxHBxKowBkidPd9Cov5GzEyvC7XTpuo/edit?usp=sharing (about designing dialog and interactions)

ToDo:
- [x] do the PawnKind properly, create Base for Outcasts;
- [x] add custom backstories, about 3 + 3, so there's bit of randomness but at the same time character's story is not all over the place;
- [x] pawn spawning with synthread or hyperweave. Solution: create custom faction.
- [x] add Z Level (make terrain);
- [x] add Z hediffs, thoughts and dialog for Z;
- [x] option for spoilers added!;
- [x] setup object in Z Level to interact with;
- [x] add more dirt around the house;
- [x] work out how to send signal to destroy Z Level entrance. Done!
- [x] work out how to make quest spawn only once. Not viable ATM;
- [x] add hostile response to destroying walls;
- [x] rewrite bit about survival meal;
- [x] rewrite bit about z level, foreshadow action unlocked by hediff;
- [x] redo strange walls to be destructible and deconstructible;
- [x] remove "visible if not available" in conditions;
- [x] add generated messages when important changes take place: ZDreamer hostile, recruited, etc. Wallbreaker - would spam with messages.
- [x] make sure signals are working (spot.destroyed);
- [x] add a dialog version to read in the crapper;

- [x] rat bonus dialog
