<Spoiler_ZDreamerO>The rat looks up at you. In {Interviewee_possessive} jet black eyes glimmers sadness of the ages.
\n\n"Thou hast cleaned this pitiful place and for this I would share my wisdom with thee. Words unspoken, paths not taken - a sage rat knows them well! But beware, humanling. With great knowledge oft comes great saddness-"
\n\nYou stare at {Interviewee_objective} in a quiet shock. {Interviewee_nameDef} clears {Interviewee_possessive} throat.
\n\n"OK, let me put it to you straight. I can replay the whole conversation for you, but if you don't want to shatter the fragile balance of this quest, don't talk to me about legacies." 
\n\n{Interviewee_pronoun} moves {Interviewee_possessive} whiskers up and down.
\n\n"Don't worry if you don't understand. Maybe you didn't talk to the guy yet, and instead decided to do some toilet cleaning first. Who knows? Humans are strange."
\n\n"And by Randy I beg you, don't recruit me. I'm hungry, I'm missing a kidney and I don't want to be a part of swarm defending your home. So after we're done leave the door open, would you?"
